  <p class="xmas_message--body">I wasn't sure what to put for this day because I figured you'd expect some massive show-stopper day. The idea I had was kind of a year in review, like you suggested we do together. It'd be cute to do it IRL, but here's my version.</p>
  <p class="xmas_message--body mb-3">Right now I have 357 (!) starred messages in WhatsApp for our chat. Everytime you said something cute, or something happened that felt like a milestone, I starred it (I'm lame). Below are some highlights :)</p>

Basically I starred things when I didn't think saying how they made me felt was a good idea; didn't want to be too keen. So when you said this and hinted about us living together I starred it in like 0.6 seconds</p>
